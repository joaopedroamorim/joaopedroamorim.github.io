			the deployment and processing of XBT data. Before this cruise, my field experience was mostly related to join in small boats expeditions alongs the Par√° coast. That was the first time I had the opportunity to be in a subtropical ocean expedition, in contact with new equipments and people, for sure a very valuable experience of more than 15 days in the sea.
