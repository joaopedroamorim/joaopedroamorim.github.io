		<h2> Gordon Research Conference - Coastal Ocean Dynamics (2023) </h2>
		<p align = "justify"> My first trip outside my home country, Brazil, was in 2023 to participate in the Gordon Research Conference – Coastal Ocean Dynamics. It was an excellent opportunity to engage with experts in the field of coastal oceanography and shelf-slope exchanges. 
			I also presented a poster on the first article of my thesis, which focused on the characterization of Brazil Current cyclones and shelf-slope exchanges 
			near Cape Santa Marta.

		<h2> SAMOWA CRUISE (2018) - South Atlantic Ocean </h2>
		<p align = "justify"> 
During the winter of 2018, I had the opportunity to join the South Atlantic Mode Water (SAMOWA) cruise expedition, led by Dr. Olga Sato. At that time, I was a master's student under her supervision, and my duties included the deployment and processing of XBT data. Before this cruise, my field experience was mostly related to participating in small boat expeditions along the Pará coast. This was the first time I had the opportunity to be part of a subtropical ocean expedition, in contact with new equipment and people. It was definitely a very valuable experience of more than 15 days at sea.
