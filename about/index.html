		<p align="justify"> I'm a physical oceanographer, graduated from the <a href="https://ufpa.br/">Federal University of Pará</a> (2018), with a MSc. in Physical Oceanography at the <a href="https://www.io.usp.br/"> University of São Paulo</a> (2020), with a broadly range of interest in oceanic movements. Currently, I'm a PhD Student, focusing my research topics into ocean mesoscale and submesoscale dynamics and shelf-slope water exchanges. Also, I'm a tech enthusiast, so topics like Artificial Intelligence applied to earth sciences are always welcome :) </p>
