		<p> align="justify"> I'm a physical oceanographer, with a broadly range of interest in oceanic movements. Currently, I'm focusing my research topics into ocean mesoscale dynamics and eddy-eddy interactions. Also, I'm a tech enthusiast, so topics like L Artificial Intelligence applied to earth sciences are always welcome :) </p>
