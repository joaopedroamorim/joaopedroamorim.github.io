		<h2> Projeto de Caracterização Regional da Bacia de Santos (2021 - Current) </h2>
		<p align = "justify"> After working on Rede Rio Doce Mar, I joined into the <a href = "https://comunicabaciadesantos.petrobras.com.br/programa-ambiental/projeto-de-caracterizacao-regional-da-bacia-de-santos-pcr-bs.html">PCR - Bacia de Santos</a> to work as a Physical Oceanographer into the
			Physical Oceanography division, in a partnership between <a href = "https://petrobras.com.br/pt/">PETROBRAS</a> and the <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/la-do?fbclid=PAAabA6tYgHAfAtstWZevidXvefdWyI_NiNTDhkT2125TdjglJ5jmiRP38N48">Ocean Dynamics Laboratory</a> from University of São Paulo. Here, I'm responsible
			for data analysis and processing, write technical and scientific reports and generate knowledge about the mesoscale circulation on the Continental Slope and Deep Waters at the South Brazil Bight.

		<h2> Rede Rio Doce Mar (2020 - 2021) </h2>
		<p align ="justify"> After finishing my Masters, I worked for 1 year at <a href ="https://rrdm.net.br/"> Rede Rio Doce Mar </a>, a collaborative research network between <a href=http://www.fest.org.br/fest2018/> Espirito Santense Technology Foundation </a> and <a href="https://www.fundacaorenova.org/" >Renova </a>. I was a research supervisor into the Ocean Modelling group and our main objective was to investigate the dynamics from Doce river plume on the shelf. My activities consisted of data processing, analysis and model implementation, and also wrote scientific and technical reports.

		<h2> South Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation SAMOC (2018 -2020) </h2>
		<p align="justify"> During my Masters, I was member of the Satellite Oceanographic Lab at the Oceanographic Institute of the Sao Paulo University. My thesis insvetigated the spreading of the Antartic Intermediate Water (AAIW) over the entire Atlantic Basin, and how this process could be linked with the South Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. For that, I used both in situ delivered data products and also outputs from two ocean models, the results obtained can be found

		<h2> Sargassum Blooms on Amazon Coast (2016 - 2017) </h2>
		<p align="justify"> During May 2014 and Apr 2015, several tons of <em> Sargassum sp </em> bleached on Amazon Coast as reported on <a href="https://g1.globo.com/pa/para/noticia/2015/04/algas-marinhas-mudam-paisagem-da-praia-do-atalaia-em-salinas.html"> local news </a>. During this project, I investigated how ocean currents, near surface winds and regional precipitation could driven and transport these algae from a region above the equator to northern Brazil coast. 
		The results obtained showed that these events were associated with extremely high precipitation months due the presence of ITCZ, which caused sourthward anomalies on winds, directed towards the coast. The gray literature resulted from this work
