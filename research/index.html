		<h2> Sargassum Blooms on Amazon Coast </h2>
		<p> During May 2014 and Apr 2015, several tons of Sargassum sp bleached on Amazon Coast as reported on <a href="https://g1.globo.com/pa/para/noticia/2015/04/algas-marinhas-mudam-paisagem-da-praia-do-atalaia-em-salinas.html"> local news </a>. During this project, I investigated how ocean currents, near surface winds and regional precipitation could driven and transport these algae from a region above the equator to northern Brazil coast. 
		The results obtained showed that these events were associated with extremely high precipitation months due the presence of ITCZ, which caused sourthward anomalies on winds, directed towards the coast. The gray literature resulted from this work
