		<h2> Sargassum Blooms on Amazon Coast </h2>
		<p> During May 2014 and Apr 2015, several tons of Sargassum sp bleached on Amazon Coast as reported on <a href="https://g1.globo.com/pa/para/noticia/2015/04/algas-marinhas-mudam-paisagem-da-praia-do-atalaia-em-salinas.html"> local news </a>. During this project, I investigated how ocean currents, near surface winds and regional precipitation could driven and transport these algae from a region above the equator to northern Brazil coast. </p>
