title: "Useful xarray commands for Satellite data"

The <a href ="https://xarray.dev/" > Xarray libray </a> is an open source project and Python package that introduces labels in the form of dimensions, 
coordinates, and attributes on top of raw NumPy-like arrays,which allows for more intuitive, more concise, and less error-prone user experience. I personally
consider it like a Pandas designed for geosciences, with very powerful tools to easily manipulate 3D large datasets. <a href="https://github.com/joaopedroamorim/DS_Codes/blob/main/XArray_Useful.ipynb">In this code</a>, I make some computation
in a huge dataset (daily global maps from 1993 to 2019 of geostrophic velocity obtained by altimeters) and plot the results. 

The computations includes slicing data for a specific region (the South Brazil), compute a 60-day running mean and then obtain spatial derivates, to compute the horizontal shear production 
and the gradient of the total vorticity, after that, I group these variables by months and seasons. These calculations are done with few lines of commands and would require much more effort (and time) if I decide to work with 3D arrays only instead of xarray built-in functions.
