Objected Oriented Programming is a model of programming that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. In this post I'm sharing
a code using general class for producing 2D Maps using data from <a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/"> ETOPO bathymetry  </a>. You can find this code <a href="https://github.com/joaopedroamorim/ObjectOrientedOcean/blob/main/Etopo_Map.ipynb">here</a>.
